### Development

If you're using this sample app for development of the dynoscale library this moght come handy.

Open two terminal windows and navigate to `./examples/express_simple` in both of them.

1. In the first one run `pnpm relative-deps watch`.
2. In the second one run `pnpm run dev`

Now as you work on `./dynoscale` the server will rebuild and reinstall dynoscale in the example app.
